# UnityRockAndLamp
This is an example of a photorealistic Unity Game I made. The 3D Models and Texture Maps were made in Cinema4D and the game was coded in C#. This is the same lamp model that I made for the livingroom render on my 3D Portfolio! The photorealism part is in the way the lighing, textures, and sculpting. The rock looks pretty realistic and if you look closely, you can even see dirt and dust on it!
The controls for the game are WASD for movement, X to reset your position (you are the rock) Z to turn the lamp on and off and hold SPACE to hover. The lamp has no gravity, but you do.
If you aren't able to run the game for any reason, feel free to take a look at the screenshots in the folder labeled Screenshots.
#### To Run the game, execute `LampAndRock.exe` in the Windows Build Folder.
#### Alternatively, you can run it on your browser here: http://ronakparikhnj.com/rpwebgl
Note: It takes a little while for the game to load.
