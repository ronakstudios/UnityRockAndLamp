# UnityRockAndLamp
This is an example of a photorealistic Unity Game I made. The 3D Models and Texture Maps were made in Cinema4D and the game was coded in C#. This is the same lamp model that I made for the livingroom render on my 3D Portfolio!
The controls for the game are WASD for movement, X to reset your position (you are the rock) and hold SPACE to hover. If you aren't able to run the game for any reason, feel free to take a look at the screenshots in the folder labeled Screenshots.
#### To Run the game, execute `LampAndRock.exe` in the Windows Build Folder.
Note: It takes a little while for the game to load.
