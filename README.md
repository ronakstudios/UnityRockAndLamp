# UnityRockAndLamp
This is an example of a Unity Game I made. The 3D Models and Texture Maps were made in Cinema4D and the game was coded in C#. This is the same lamp model that I made for the livingroom render on my 3D Portfolio!
#### To Run the game, execute `LampAndRock.exe` in the Windows Build Folder.
Note: It takes a little while for the game to load.
